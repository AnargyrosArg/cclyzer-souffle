Since cclyzer in souffle is under development, to execute it correctly we still use an alternative process:

All of the following commands are run from the main directory.

First we run the fact generator on the bitcode file we want to examine. For example:
bin/fact-generator -o facts/ tests/coreutils-8.24/ls.bc
Then we run cti.py located in the main directory to pre-process the facts in order for them to be parsable by the Souffle engine:
- python cti.py facts/
You may then use the souffle interpreter with the following command:
- souffle --profile=cclyzer.log -F facts/ -D results/ src/logic/master.project
